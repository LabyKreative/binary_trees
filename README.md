# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Definition
A ***binary tree*** is a tree data structure composed of nodes, each of which has at most, two children, referred to as left and right nodes. The tree starts off with a single node known as the root.

***Binary Search*** Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

## More Information

### Data structures
The following data structures and types are used for binary trees and included in header file.

### Basic Binary Tree
```
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
```
### Binary Search Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
```
### AVL Tree
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
```
### Max Binary Heap
```
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
```
